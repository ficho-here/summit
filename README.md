# *SUMMIT*

*In the year 2050 global warming became a very big problem and on the date of 25. December. Yeah Christmas every single part of Antarctica melted and everyone was evacuated. There was a kid that was a boy scout he was on let's say a solo mission in the wood to catch a deer. While everyone was being evacuated to bunkers he was siting there patiently waiting for the perfect time to strike a deer. Then he noticed water rising QUICKLY! He decided to sprint to the mountain near by and here we are climbing the mountain.*

- You play as the boy scout climbing the mountain to escape the water
- I like turtles
